    <p>
        Jack Figure is a cheerful young man who loves adventure and exploring new places. 
        He spends most of his time hiking, drawing maps, and helping others find their way. 
        His friends call him “Navigator Jack” because he never gets lost!
    </p>

    <p>
        One thing that makes Jack special is his <i>unbreakable curiosity</i> — 
        he’s always asking questions and learning something new every day.
